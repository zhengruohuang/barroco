# The Barroco Architecture
Barroco is a clean and designed-from-scratch architecture. It aims to provide a modern and clean ISA, a toolchain, a full-system emulator, and the most important, a synthesizable state-of-the-art out-of-order microprocessor in Verilog, all available in BSD licence.
Over the past decades, people have conducted a tramendous amount of research on computer architecture. We have seen so many promising techiniques in the papers, but have not yet been adopted by current commericial products. Barroco's job is to bring the promising techniques to the public.
